## Task 1
 ### To run the program in file Task1.cpp:
 - The following link can be used to run the code online: https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/
 - Delete all the codes on the left panel already on the link. 
 - Just copy all the content of Task1.cpp and paste on the left panel.
 - Run the code from the 'Run' button.
 ### Solution:
 - Program takes a single input at first line then n-1 space separated integers i.e., 1 to n-1.
 - The 1 to n-1 range of numbers are stored in a vector data structure.
 - Vector containing the numbers is passed to a function getMissingNo along with its size.
 - The function works as follow: it takes the size of vector to calculate the sum of n numbers, then subtracts the sum of numbers in vector to obtain the missing value.
 - Lastly, the missing number is returned to print it on the console.
